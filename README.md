### Understanding

`application.py`

Open up `application.py`. Atop the file are a bunch of imports, among them CS50’s SQL module and a few helper functions. More on those soon.

After configuring Flask, notice how this file disables caching of responses (provided you’re in debugging mode, which you are by default on CS50 IDE), lest you make a change to some file but your browser not notice. Notice next how it configures Jinja with a custom “filter,” `usd`, a function (defined in `helpers.py`) that will make it easier to format values as US dollars (USD). It then further configures Flask to store sessions on the local filesystem (i.e., disk) as opposed to storing them inside of (digitally signed) cookies, which is Flask’s default. The file then configures CS50’s SQL module to use `finance.db`, a SQLite database whose contents we’ll soon see!

Thereafter are a whole bunch of routes, only two of which are fully implemented: `login` and `logout`. Read through the implementation of `login` first. Notice how it uses `db.execute` (from CS50’s library) to query `finance.db`. And notice how it uses `check_password_hash` to compare hashes of users’ passwords. Finally, notice how `login` “remembers” that a user is logged in by storing his or her `user_id`, an INTEGER, in `session`. That way, any of this file’s routes can check which user, if any, is logged in. Meanwhile, notice how `logout` simply clears session, effectively logging a user out.

Notice how most routes are “decorated” with `@login_required` (a function defined in `helpers.py` too). That decorator ensures that, if a user tries to visit any of those routes, he or she will first be redirected to `login` so as to log in.

Notice too how most routes support GET and POST. Even so, most of them (for now!) simply return an “apology,” since they’re not yet implemented.

`helpers.py`

Next take a look at `helpers.py`. Ah, there’s the implementation of `apology`. Notice how it ultimately renders a template, `apology.html`. It also happens to define within itself another function, `escape`, that it simply uses to replace special characters in apologies. By defining `escape` inside of `apology`, we’ve scoped the former to the latter alone; no other functions will be able (or need) to call it.

Next in the file is `login_required`. No worries if this one’s a bit cryptic, but if you’ve ever wondered how a function can return another function, here’s an example!

Thereafter is `lookup`, a function that, given a `symbol` (e.g., NFLX), returns a stock quote for a company in the form of a `dict` with three keys: `name`, whose value is a `str`, the name of the company; `price`, whose value is a `float`; and `symbol`, whose value is a `str`, a canonicalized (uppercase) version of a stock’s symbol, irrespective of how that symbol was capitalized when passed into `lookup`.

Last in the file is `usd`, a short function that simply formats a `float` as USD (e.g., `1234.56` is formatted as `$1,234.56`).

`requirements.txt`

Next take a quick look at `requirements.txt`. That file simply prescribes the packages on which this app will depend.

`static/`

Glance too at `static/`, inside of which is `styles.css`. That’s where some initial CSS lives. You’re welcome to alter it as you see fit.

`templates/`

Now look in `templates/`. In `login.html` is, essentially, just an HTML form, stylized with Bootstrap. In `apology.html`, meanwhile, is a template for an apology. Recall that `apology` in `helpers.py` took two arguments: `message`, which was passed to `render_template` as the value of bottom, and, optionally, `code`, which was passed to `render_template` as the value of top. Notice in `apology.html` how those values are ultimately used! And here’s why. 0:-)

Last up is `layout.html`. It’s a bit bigger than usual, but that’s mostly because it comes with a fancy, mobile-friendly “navbar” (navigation bar), also based on Bootstrap. Notice how it defines a block, `main`, inside of which templates (including `apology.html` and `login.html`) shall go. It also includes support for Flask’s message flashing so that you can relay messages from one route to another for the user to see.

## Specification

### register

Complete the implementation of `register` in such a way that it allows a user to register for an account via a form.

- Require that a user input a username, implemented as a text field whose `name` is `username`. Render an apology if the user’s input is blank or the username already exists.
- Require that a user input a password, implemented as a text field whose `name` is `password`, and then that same password again, implemented as a text field whose `name` is `confirmation`. Render an apology if either input is blank or the passwords do not match.
- Submit the user’s input via `POST` to `/register`.
- `INSERT` the new user into `users`, storing a hash of the user’s password, not the password itself. Hash the user’s password with `generate_password_hash`. Odds are you’ll want to create a new template (e.g., `register.html`) that’s quite similar to `login.html`.

Once you’ve implemented `register` correctly, you should be able to register for an account and log in (since `login` and `logout` already work)! And you should be able to see your rows via phpLiteAdmin or `sqlite3`.

### quote

Complete the implementation of `quote` in such a way that it allows a user to look up a stock’s current price.

- Require that a user input a stock’s symbol, implemented as a text field whose `name` is `symbol`.
- Submit the user’s input via `POST` to `/quote`.
- Odds are you’ll want to create two new templates (e.g., `quote.html` and `quoted.html`). When a user visits `/quote` via GET, render one of those templates, inside of which should be an HTML form that submits to `/quote` via POST. In response to a POST, `quote` can render that second template, embedding within it one or more values from `lookup`.

### buy

Complete the implementation of `buy` in such a way that it enables a user to buy stocks.

- Require that a user input a stock’s symbol, implemented as a text field whose `name` is `symbol`. Render an apology if the input is blank or the symbol does not exist (as per the return value of `lookup`).
- Require that a user input a number of shares, implemented as a text field whose `name` is `shares`. Render an apology if the input is not a positive integer.
Submit the user’s input via `POST` to `/buy`.
- Odds are you’ll want to call `lookup` to look up a stock’s current price.
- Odds are you’ll want to `SELECT` how much cash the user currently has in `users`.
- Add one or more new tables to `finance.db` via which to keep track of the purchase. Store enough information so that you know who bought what at what price and when.
  - Use appropriate SQLite types.
  - Define `UNIQUE` indexes on any fields that should be unique.
  - Define (non-`UNIQUE`) indexes on any fields via which you will search (as via `SELECT` with `WHERE`).
- Render an apology, without completing a purchase, if the user cannot afford the number of shares at the current price.
- You don’t need to worry about race conditions (or use transactions).

Once you’ve implemented `buy` correctly, you should be able to see users’ purchases in your new table(s) via phpLiteAdmin or `sqlite3`.

### index

- Complete the implementation of `index` in such a way that it displays an HTML table summarizing, for the user currently logged in, which stocks the user owns, the numbers of shares owned, the current price of each stock, and the total value of each holding (i.e., shares times price). Also display the user’s current cash balance along with a grand total (i.e., stocks’ total value plus cash).

- Odds are you’ll want to execute multiple `SELECT`s. Depending on how you implement your table(s), you might find GROUP BY HAVING SUM and/or WHERE of interest.
- Odds are you’ll want to call `lookup` for each stock.

### sell

Complete the implementation of `sell` in such a way that it enables a user to sell shares of a stock (that he or she owns).

- Require that a user input a stock’s symbol, implemented as a `select` menu whose `name` is `symbol`. Render an apology if the user fails to select a stock or if (somehow, once submitted) the user does not own any shares of that stock.
- Require that a user input a number of shares, implemented as a text field whose `name` is `shares`. Render an apology if the input is not a positive integer or if the user does not own that many shares of the stock.
- Submit the user’s input via `POST` to `/sell`.
- You don’t need to worry about race conditions (or use transactions).

### history

Complete the implementation of `history` in such a way that it displays an HTML table summarizing all of a user’s transactions ever, listing row by row each and every buy and every sell.

For each row, make clear whether a stock was bought or sold and include the stock’s symbol, the (purchase or sale) price, the number of shares bought or sold, and the date and time at which the transaction occurred.
You might need to alter the table you created for `buy` or supplement it with an additional table. Try to minimize redundancies.

### personal touch

Implement at least one personal touch of your choice:

- Allow users to change their passwords.
- Allow users to add additional cash to their account.
- Allow users to buy more shares or sell shares of stocks they already own via index itself, without having to type stocks’ symbols manually.
- Require users’ passwords to have some number of letters, numbers, and/or symbols.
- Implement some other feature of comparable scope.
